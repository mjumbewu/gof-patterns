A simple web-based mobile app for flashing through the Gang of Four design
patterns. To build, simply run 'make'. When it asks whether you want to create a
superuser, you can just enter 'no'. The 'index.html' file, along with the
'diagrams' and 'static' folders need to be deployed. If your server does not
automatically serve .manifest files with the text/cache-manifest mime type, you
will need to upload the .htaccess file as well (assuming you're using Apache;
otherwise, look up the solution for your web server). If you're using Apache but
don't know whether your server serves text/cache-manifest, go ahead and deploy
the .htaccess file anyway.
